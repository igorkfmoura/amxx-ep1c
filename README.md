# amxx-ep1c

This repository contains plugins and server resources used by **ep1c Gaming Brasil** for our Counter-Strike 1.6 servers:

1. 4fun (laid-back 16 vs 16 gameplay)

1. Mix/PUG (competitive 5 vs 5 matches)

1. CTF (Capture the Flag 16 vs 16), including CTF-Match for competitive CTF games.

Most plugins were hardcoded in Portuguese (PT-BR), as internationalization was never a priority.

While you'll find several original plugins here, the majority are adaptations of either well-known public plugins or private ones that were purchased or traded.
At the time, it was unfortunately common for people to remove or replace original plugin credits. I did my best to preserve authorship wherever possible.

Some plugins were also copied from my public plugin folder:

These files are shared as-is. Feel free to reach out if you have questions — but please understand that active support is unlikely.

Those were truly good times.
In the end, it was never really about the servers or the plugins — it was about the experience, and the people who shared it with us.

We were just tending to the last ember, hoping it would glow for just a little longer.

Cheers,
